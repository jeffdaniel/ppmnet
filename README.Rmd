# ppmnet

<!-- badges: start -->

`ppmnet` is an R package for fitting regularized spatial point process models.

Models are fit via penalized likelihood for Poisson point processes, and via penalized composite likelihood for Gibbs point processes. 
The model-fitting procedure is carried out by `glmnet`, which implements the lasso and elastic net penalties.
A number of methods are provided for plotting, prediction, validation, and model selection on the basis of (composite) information criteria.

This package closely conforms to the conventions of the `spatstat` package, and relies heavily on `spatstat` classes and functions. As such, use of `ppmnet` should be straightforward to those familiar with `spatstat`.

## Installation

You can install `ppmnet` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jeffdaniel/ppmnet")
```

## Example

Fit a regularized inhomogeneous Poisson point process model to the `bei` dataset
included with `spatstat`.
```{r beifit}
fit <- ppmnet(quadscheme(bei), bei.extra)
```

Select the optimal model from the regularization path on the basis of minimum AIC and plot the model's predicted intensity surface.
```{r beiplot}
lambda <- select(fit, "AIC")$lambda
plot(predict(fit, bei.extra, s = lambda))
```

Examine the smoothed residual field for the selected model.
```{r resplot}
plot(Smooth(residuals(fit, s = lambda)))
```
